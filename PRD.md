### Data Flow
1. **Log Creation**: User calls logging methods or decorators
2. **Validation**: Pydantic models validate log structure
3. **Storage**: DLT pipeline writes to DuckDB
4. **Console**: Loguru handles formatted console output
5. **Query**: Users can SQL query DuckDB directly

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE job_logs (
    id                UUID            PRIMARY KEY,
    project_name      TEXT            NOT NULL,
